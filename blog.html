                            <p>Session and local storage are browser storage methods that let you store data alongside stateless HTTP requests. They are an alternative to cookie-based storage and have many uses in web development.</p>
                            <p>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that with sessionStorage , the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage , the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data.</p>

                            <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
                            <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                            <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.</p>
